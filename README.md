# Welcome!
This is a website I made just to mess around with random internet stuff. Nothing really important is here yet. (Although that may change in the future...)
Want me to add something to the website? Go to the [discussion board for this project](https://github.com/TheComputerCrasher/TheComputerCrasher.github.io/discussions) on [:GitHub](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) and ask! 
(If you don't have a GitHub account, you can make one for free [here](https://github.com/signup).)
Or, since nobody seems to want to use the fancy way, you can just ask me personally to add something new to the site.

# Super Paper Mario stuff
Some of you might just be here for my Super Paper Mario stuff. If so, here are the links (more coming soon hopefully!):

# : Secret
Ooh, you found a secret! Wonder where this leads...
You can [:enter a mysterious maze](#Maze), or [:not enter it at all](#Boring).

# :x Maze
You enter a mysterious maze. There are three tunnels from the entrance, marked by some unreadable ancient symbols. Of course, you still have the option to leave.
You can enter the [:left tunnel](#EntranceLeft), the [:middle tunnel](#EntranceMiddle), the [:right tunnel](#EntranceRight), or you can just [:leave](#Boring).

# :x Entrance
You head back to the room where you entered the maze. The three tunnels are still here, waiting for you. The entrance shines with the outside sunlight.
You can enter the [:left tunnel](#EntranceLeft), the [:middle tunnel](#EntranceMiddle), the [:right tunnel](#EntranceRight), or you can just [:leave](#Boring).

# :x Boring
You decide to leave. It turned out to be a very boring choice! Why in the world did you do that?
Maybe [:enter the maze again](#Maze)?

# :x Entrance Left
You arrive in a room full of monsters! ...Luckily, a giant green owl already defeated all of them, so you're safe. 
![Duo, the mascot of Duolingo, stares at you menacingly](https://github.com/TheComputerCrasher/TheComputerCrasher.github.io/blob/main/files/Duo.png?raw=true)
There are only two tunnels in this room: the one you came from, and one that leads to a new room. Which way do you go?
You can [:go back](#Entrance) or [:enter the next room](#LeftContinued).

# :x Entrance Middle
You enter this room, but there's nothing here! It seems like the maze's creator isn't quite finished designing the rooms yet. Maybe come back another time? 
[:Go back](#Entrance).

# :x Entrance Right
You enter this room, but there's nothing here! It seems like the maze's creator isn't quite finished designing the rooms yet. Maybe come back another time? 
[:Go back](#Entrance).

# :x Left (Continued)
You enter this room, but there's nothing here! It seems like the maze's creator isn't quite finished designing the rooms yet. Maybe come back another time? 
[:Go back](#EntranceLeft).
