# Welcome!
This is a website I made just to mess around with random internet stuff. Nothing really important is here yet. (Although that may change in the future...)

# Shoutouts
* Shoutout to my brother [:judoanimates](https://youtu.be/LK7eZHzk460)
* Shoutout to my online friends who used to be on [:Scratch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_(programming_language)) before they left for various reasons
* Shoutout to all the people I know IRL, who I can't link to or name here for obvious reasons

# Credits

# : Secret
Ooh, you found a secret! Wonder where this leads...
You can [:enter a mysterious cave](#Cave), or [:not enter it at all](#Boring).

# :x Cave
You enter a mysterious cave. There are three tunnels in the cave walls, marked by some unreadable ancient symbols. Of course, you still have the option to leave.
You can enter the [:left tunnel](#EntranceLeft), the [:middle tunnel](#EntranceMiddle), the [:right tunnel](#EntranceRight), or you can just [:leave](#Boring).

# :x Entrance
You head back to the room where you entered the cave. The three tunnels are still here, waiting for you. The cave's entrance shines with the outside sunlight.
You can enter the [:left tunnel](#EntranceLeft), the [:middle tunnel](#EntranceMiddle), the [:right tunnel](#EntranceRight), or you can just [:leave](#Boring).

# :x Boring
You decide to leave. It turned out to be a very boring choice! Why in the world did you do that?
Maybe [:enter the cave again](#Cave)?

# :x Entrance Left
You arrive in a room full of monsters! ...Luckily, it seems like someone else already defeated all of them, so you're safe. 
There are only two tunnels in this room: the one you came from, and one that leads to a new room. Which way do you go?
You can [:go back](#Entrance) or [:enter the next room](#LeftContinued).

# :x Entrance Middle
You enter this room, but there's nothing here! It almost seems like the cave's creator isn't quite finished designing the rooms yet. Maybe come back another time? 
[:Go back](#Entrance).

# :x Entrance Right
You enter this room, but there's nothing here! It almost seems like the cave's creator isn't quite finished designing the rooms yet. Maybe come back another time? 
[:Go back](#Entrance).

# :x Left (Continued)
You enter this room, but there's nothing here! It almost seems like the cave's creator isn't quite finished designing the rooms yet. Maybe come back another time? 
[:Go back](#EntranceLeft).
