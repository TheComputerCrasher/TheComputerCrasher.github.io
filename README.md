# Welcome!
This is a website I made just to mess around with random internet stuff. Nothing really important is here yet.

This site was built using [:GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
This site uses Nicky Case's [:Nutshell tool](https://ncase.me/nutshell/#WhatIsNutshell) to make my links look super cool.
