# Welcome!
This is a website I made just to mess around with random internet stuff. Nothing really important is here yet. 

# Shoutouts
* Shoutout to my brother [:judoanimates](https://youtu.be/LK7eZHzk460)
* Shoutout to my online friends who used to be on [%3AScratch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_(programming_language)#Heading&cut=1) before they left for various reasons
* Shoutout to all the other people I know IRL, who I can't link to or name here for obvious reasons

# Credits
* This site was built using [:GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
* This site also uses Nicky Case's [%3ANutshell%20tool](https://ncase.me/nutshell/#WhatIsNutshell#Heading&cut=4) to make my links look super cool.
