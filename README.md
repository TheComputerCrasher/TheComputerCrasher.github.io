# Welcome! 
This is a website I made just to mess around with random internet stuff. Nothing really important is here yet. 

# Shoutouts
* Shoutout to my brother [:judoanimates](https://youtube.com/@judoanimates)
* Shoutout to my online friends who used to be on [:Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu)
* Shoutout to all the other people I know IRL, who I can't link to or name here for obvious reasons

This site uses Nicky Case's [:Nutshell tool](https://ncase.me/nutshell/#WhatIsNutshell) to make my links look super cool.
