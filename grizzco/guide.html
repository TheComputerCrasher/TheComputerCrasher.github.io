        <h3>Basic Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>They tend to appear in groups rather than alone.</li>
            <li>Defeating them will earn you <img src="media/PowerEgg.png" alt="Power Egg">Power Eggs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Attack Behavior</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>They use their sense of smell to locate and close in on targets who have entered their territory.</li>
            <li>Once they close in on a target, they perform close-range attacks using frying pans or other cookware.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Elimination</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Can be neutralized relatively easily with a direct hit of ink.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Supporting Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>They inhabit a restricted ocean zone, and any unauthorized contact with them is expressly forbidden by
                law.</li>
            <li>The Smallfry might be weak, but they're very fast. They often ambush their targets from below.</li>
            <li>The larger Cohock moves slowly but packs a real punch with direct, strong attacks.</li>
            <li>On their own, they don't pose a significant threat, but ignore them and you may quickly find yourself
                surrounded.</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Any snatched <img src="media/1GoldenEgg.svg" alt="Golden Egg">Golden Eggs can be retrieved by defeating
                this Salmonid before it returns to the water.

        <ul>
            <li>New recruits usually start as Snatchers to give them a taste of the battlefield.</li>
            <li>Provided they demonstrate sufficient aptitude at collecting <img src="media/1GoldenEgg.svg"
                    alt="Golden Egg">Golden Eggs, they will be allowed to join the front lines.</li>
            <li>In recent years, aircraft have also been brought in to improve their egg-collection rates.

            </li>
            <li>The resulting explosion covers a large area.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Elimination</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The only way to defeat the Steelhead is to shoot ink at the bomb on its head as it inflates.
            </li>

        <h3>Supporting Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The company commander of a Salmonid troop.</li>
            <li>Its powerful physique capable of supporting heavy armor and its ink-resistant scales are the

        <h3>Supporting Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The driver of the Steel Eel wears a mask to protect itself from the spray generated by the
                machine.</li>
            <li>The great length of the Steel Eel is attributable to the large number of interconnected
                ink-sprayers used to create it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><img src="icons/S3_Icon_Scrapper.png" alt="Scrapper">Scrapper</h2>
        <h3>Basic Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Protected against almost all ink damage by their shields.</li>
            <li>Their ability to turn rapidly allows them to keep their shields facing their target.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Attack Behavior</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The protection afforded by their shields allows them to charge forwards.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Elimination</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sustained ink attacks will damage their shields and bring them to a standstill.</li>
            <li>Once the Scrapper is immobilized, move round behind it to fire through the chink in its armor
                and take it out.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Supporting Information</h3>

            <li>The Scrapper's vehicle is a much-desired item for many Salmonids.</li>
            <li>The shields are made from odds and ends of scrap metal.</li>

                attack enemies
                from a distance.</li>
            <li>The Salmonid on top wears protective equipment to absorb the shock from the jet of ink.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Appears from directly beneath its prey and swallows it in an instant.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Elimination</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You can deal damage by shooting ink at it when it surfaces to attack, but defeating it this way
                will take some
                time as it is rather robust.</li>
            <li>To bring it down in one fell swoop, trick it into swallowing a bomb by placing one at its point
                of attack.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Supporting Information</h3>

        </ul>

        <h3>Elimination</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>It is susceptible to attack immediately after it fires.</li>
            <li>With good timing, it's possible to reflect the shot and hit the Drizzler with its own projectile,
                taking it down
                in one go.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Supporting Information</h3>
        <ul>

        <ul>
            <li>It's a squad of flying Smallfry carrying a massive pillar.</li>
            <li>They plant the pillar in the ground, then fly around above the pillar, spraying ink and generally
                being a
                nuisance.</li>
            <li>After you splat them, the pillar will stick around.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Several Smallfry fly in circles above the pillar, spraying ink.</li>

        <h3>Basic Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>It swims deep below the ink, then launches high into the air before diving back down.</li>
            <li>It'll place a ring of ink as it jumps, showing where it will dive.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Attack Behavior</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>It will ink the ground within the thrown ring, then attack anyone inside the ring as it dives in.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Elimination</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>It's exposed while it's in the air getting ready to attack. That's your chance!</li>
            <li>If you ink the ground within its ring, it won't be able to dive back under, letting you make quick work
                of it.

        <h3>Supporting Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>It seems to idolize an animal said to have flourished in ancient times, which may explain why it wears a
                mask to
                make itself look more like this creature.</li>
            <li>It clearly attaches more importance to the beauty of its dives than its combat effectiveness.</li>

        <h2><img src="icons/S3_Icon_Slammin'_Lid.png" alt="Slammin' Lid">Slammin' Lid</h2>
        <h3>Basic Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>It's a pilot riding on a hovering, saucer-shaped craft.</li>
            <li>These provide support for other Salmonids by creating a circular force field that ink cannot pass
                through.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Attack Behavior</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Lesser Salmonids will be deployed from the hole on the bottom of the saucer.</li>
            <li>It will try to squash targets who walk into the force field.</li>

        <h3>Elimination</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>There is a pilot stationed on top of the craft. Defeating the pilot will destroy the craft.</li>
            <li>Walk into the barrier under the Slammin' Lid, then quickly dodge when the craft drops down to splat you.
                Once
                it's down, that's your chance to get on top and attack the pilot.</li>

        <h3>Supporting Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The cutting-edge technology incorporated into the craft was obtained by trading with Octarians.</li>
            <li>Because of the high cost to build these, only highly experienced veterans are allowed to pilot them.
            </li>
            <li>To save on weight, the craft has no weapons. This is why it attacks by trying to smash enemies beneath

        <h3>Basic Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>These set up a Big Shot launcher near the shore. The Big Shot launcher is loaded with cannonballs
                carried in
                from the sea, which it then fires.</li>
            <li>The attending Salmonid itself is not aggressive–it just passively goes back and forth between the sea
                and the

        <h3>Attack Behavior</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>It will fire its cannonballs in the direction of the egg basket.</li>
            <li>When a cannonball lands, it creates two shock-wave attacks.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Elimination</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Take out the Salmonid operating the Big Shot launcher.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Supporting Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Among muscle-bound Salmonids, those with belligerent personalities tend to be assigned as Steelheads,
                while those with calmer dispositions are assigned to Big Shots.</li>
            <li>On Salmonid holidays, Big Shot workers like to launch special fireworks in place of cannonballs to make
                things more festive.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Known Occurrences</h1>

        <h2>Water Levels (high and low tides)</h2>
        <h3>Low Tide</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>When the tide goes out a large amount of land that is usually underwater will be exposed.</li>
            <li>Salmonid warriors use this land as a staging ground from which to launch coordinated attacks.</li>
            <li>During low tide, the egg basket will be near this newly exposed land.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>High Tide</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>When high tide is in, there'll be much less land available.</li>
            <li>The egg basket will be in its normal place.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Advice from Mr. Grizz</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>During low tide, you gotta get together and move, move, move down to that exposed land, kid!</li>
            <li>During high tide—I don't care how hard it is—you gotta survive against those Salmonids!</li>

        <h3>Supplementary Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The sudden and irregular changes in the water levels are a rare phenomenon found only in this area.</li>
            <li>The cause is as yet unknown, and is the subject of much research throughout the academic world.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Rush</h2>
        <h3>What Happens</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Large groups of ferocious Salmonids appear and carry out rush attacks at furious speed.</li>
            <li>These crazed Salmonids gather in response to the appearance of Glowflies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Get <img src="media/1GoldenEgg.svg" alt="Golden Egg">Golden Eggs</h3>

        <h3>Advice from Mr. Grizz</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Stand your ground with your allies and concentrate your fire on the incoming Salmonids!</li>
            <li>Watch out for the Glowflies—if they buzz around you, a concentrated attack won't be far behind.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Supplementary Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>It is claimed that the Salmonids' increased aggression is tied somehow to gravitational shifts due to
                the
                planet's celestial course, but there is still much that is unclear.</li>
            <li>It is said that in pre-medieval times, before effective defense measures such as long-range ink attacks
                were
                available, many cities fell before the rage of the Salmonid rush.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Fog</h2>
        <h3>What Happens</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The area is covered in a dense fog, drastically reducing visibility.</li>
            <li>Enemies will take advantage of the fog and attack from all directions.</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Defeat Boss Salmonids.</li>
            <li>The extremely rare Goldies may appear in foggy conditions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Advice from Mr. Grizz</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Try to maintain contact with your teammates at all times while in the fog.</li>
            <li>Being alone in the fog is extremely dangerous.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Supplementary Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Goldies are extremely rare Salmonids—only one of every 10,000 hatchlings is a Goldie.</li>
            <li>They live longer than and possess far superior intelligence to normal Salmonid specimens.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><img src="icons/S3_Icon_Griller.png" alt="Griller">The Griller</h2>
        <h3>What Happens</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Armored vehicles called Grillers spawn one after the other. Grillers lock their sights on to a target
                and will
                pursue it relentlessly.</li>
            <li>Smallfry are known for hitching a ride on the Griller and interfering with its targeting.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Get <img src="media/1GoldenEgg.svg" alt="Golden Egg">Golden Eggs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Attack the weak spot on the back of the Griller to stun it.</li>
            <li>Stunning Grillers will reveal further weak points. Attacking these weak points is the key to taking down
                Grillers and getting <img src="media/1GoldenEgg.svg" alt="Golden Egg">Golden Eggs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Advice from Mr. Grizz</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If the Griller has you in its sights, you're better off running away and letting your friends handle it.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Supplementary Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Operating costs for a single Griller would be enough to deploy 100 regular Salmonid fighters.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><img src="icons/S3_Icon_Cohock.png" alt="Cohock">Cohock Charge</h2>
        <h3>What Happens</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cohocks will attack in large numbers from exposed sandbanks.</li>
            <li>Mr. Grizz will deploy a cannon for you to use in dealing with these foes.</li>

            <li>Use the cannon well to clear the way for your coworkers!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Supplementary Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Apparently there are special rooms in the Salmonid barracks set aside for large numbers of Cohocks to
                gather and
                practice.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><img src="icons/S3_Icon_Goldie.png" alt="Goldie">Goldie Seeking</h2>
        <h3>What Happens</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Large numbers of Gushers will appear in the area.</li>
            <li>A Goldie will be hiding in one of the Gushers.</li>
            <li>Other Salmonids will attack in their masses from the shores.</li>
            <li>Shooting open a gusher without a Goldie in it will cause it to erupt. Thankfully, there won't be
                anything hiding
                inside.</li>

        <h3>Advice from Mr. Grizz</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Spread out, and find that Goldie FAST.</li>
            <li>When you find the Goldie, call your buddies over and let loose with all your firepower!</li>
            <li>The Gushers emit light when you hit them--the brighter the light, the closer you are to that glorious
                Goldie.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Supplementary Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Salmonids obtained the technology to create Gushers through trade with Octarians.</li>
            <li>The more you hit the Goldie, the faster it will move!</li>

        <ul>
            <li>New troops are brought to the battleground from the Mothership.</li>
            <li>A large number of Chinooks will bring containers of lesser Salmonids from the Mothership to join the
                fray.</li>
            <li>Periodically, the Mothership will draw close to the egg basket and try to suck up and reclaim any Golden
                Eggs
                inside.</li>

        <h3>Advice from Mr. Grizz</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Split up to take out the Chinooks.</li>
            <li>If the Mothership comes to take back the <img src="media/1GoldenEgg.svg" alt="Golden Egg">Golden Eggs,

        <h3>Supplementary Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Mothership is a vital cog in the Salmonid distribution chain.</li>
            <li>Deploying the Mothership is said to be the last resort of the Salmonid army. When it is dispatched, all
                troops
                stationed nearby gather together to see it off.</li>

        <h2><img src="icons/S3_Icon_Mudmouth.png" alt="Mudmouth">Mudmouth Eruptions</h2>
        <h3>What Happens</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A Mudmouth will erupt out of the hole left by a gusher and open its huge mouth.</li>
            <li>Lesser Salmonids will start jumping out of the Mudmouth's mouth, one after another after another...</li>

            <li>If you throw in enough bombs, the Mudmouth will explode and drop even more <img

        <h3>Advice from Mr. Grizz</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Search for the Mudmouth by tracking where the Lesser Salmonids are coming from.</li>
            <li>Mudmouths multiply as time passes, so splat 'em fast!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Supplementary Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Long ago, the Mudmouth was thought to be a spirit who haunted the depths of the Splatlands seas.</li>
            <li>Now, thanks to the courage and quick thinking of Splatsville youths who thought to start throwing bombs
                into
                their mouths, we know they're just Salmonids who got stuck in a pipe and coated in mud.</li>

        <h2>Giant Tornado</h2>
        <h3>What Happens</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The ground will dry up, and a gigantic tornado will whirl to life by the shore.</li>
            <li>Anything in the sea, including Salmonids, will be sucked up by the tornado and flung towards land.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Advice from Mr. Grizz</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Since the eggs may land far away from the basket, coordinate with your coworkers and use the Egg Throw.
            </li>
            <li>Dodge any Salmonids that come flying toward you, or splat them as you transport the eggs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Supplementary Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>There's no way to predict when a giant tornado might appear. It will fling all kinds of things out from
                the
                ocean, which usually results in a great number of Salmonid casualties.</li>
            <li>Flying debris will be present, and accidents are bound to happen. If you become unable to use the egg
                basket on
                dry land, a single egg delivered to the basket will be counted as two.</li>
