        <h2>1.1.0 - To All My Happy Little Workers</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Here at Grizzco Industries, we aim to create a richer, better way of life for everyone in our society
                through daily <span style=color:#f70b6a;>collection of <img src="media/PowerEgg.png"
                        alt="Power Egg">Power Eggs.</span> We're looking for dedicated,
                eager workers to assist us as we move forward toward a brighter future. Could that be you?</li>
            <li>Collecting <img src="media/PowerEgg.png" alt="Power Egg">Power Eggs can indeed be a risky business, but
                when standing shoulder to shoulder in the
                thick of the action alongside <span style=color:#f70b6a;>coworkers united under the same vision</span>
                you may see yourself in a different
                light—an innovator, a change-bringer, one who rises to all challenges.</li>
            <li>Naturally, you will be well rewarded for your efforts. We offer an attractive and competitive
                <span style=color:#f70b6a;>remuneration package</span> to all our employees.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>1.1.1 - Collecting Power Eggs</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><img src="media/PowerEgg.png" alt="Power Egg">Power Eggs have come to be indispensable in supporting the
                modern lifestyles we all enjoy.</li>
            <li><img src="media/PowerEgg.png" alt="Power Egg">Power Eggs can be obtained from creatures called <img
                    src="icons/S3_Icon_Chum.png" alt="Chum"><span style=color:#f70b6a;>Salmonids</span>.</li>
            <li>Working for Grizzco, you'll be responsible for collecting <img src="media/1GoldenEgg.svg"
                    alt="Golden Egg"><span style=color:#f70b6a;>Golden Eggs</span> and depositing them in the
                company-issued <span style=color:#f70b6a;>egg basket</span>. These <img src="media/1GoldenEgg.svg"
                    alt="Golden Egg">Golden Eggs are obtained from <span style=color:#f70b6a;><img

                        alt="Smallfry">Lesser Salmonid</span> variety.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Steal the <img src="media/1GoldenEgg.svg" alt="Golden Egg">Golden Eggs from the Boss Salmonids!</li>
            <li>Take 'em to the egg basket!</li>
            <li>And that's it! No, really—that's all there is to it!</li>
            <li>If you can remember that, you're ready to join the ranks at Grizzco!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>1.1.3 - Joining the Team</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>As a new employee, you can rest assured in the knowledge that we offer on-site <span
                    style=color:#f70b6a;>training</span>—you won't be
                thrown in at the deep end. After all, no one expects you to memorize everything in your Employee
                Handbook right away! At Grizzco, we believe experience is the best teacher.</li>
            <li>All you could ever want to know about Salmonids is explained in detail in your <a
                    href="guide.html"><span style=color:#f70b6a;>Salmonid Field Guide</span></a>.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>1.1.4 - Getting Started</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>All new Grizzco employees are given a <span style=color:#f70b6a;>Grizzco Point Card</span>. Please take
                good care of this card—it is used
                to commemorate your professional achievements.</li>
            <li><img src="media/PowerEgg.png" alt="Power Egg">Power Egg collection is done when Salmonids engage in a
                behavior called a "<span style=color:#f70b6a;>Salmon Run</span>". This is the Salmonid habit of
                regularly returning in large
                numbers to the area where they were spawned.</li>
            <li>Because our business NEVER closes here in the Splatlands, we always have a need for more help collecting
                <img src="media/PowerEgg.png" alt="Power Egg">Power Eggs. However, where our employees collect those
                eggs will differ based on the time of day.
            </li>
            <li>All equipment necessary for collecting <img src="media/PowerEgg.png" alt="Power Egg">Power Eggs
                (weapons, gear, life ring) will be provided by the company. There is no need for employees to prepare
                anything themselves, so first-timers needn't worry.
            </li>
            <li>This job requires the use of specially optimized equipment well-suited to the task at hand. This means
                that workers will be <span style=color:#f70b6a;>unable to charge their special gauges</span> themselves.
                Instead, Grizzco will arrange for <span style=color:#f70b6a;>two uses of a special ability</span>, which
                you may activate when you deem necessary. Unused special-ability activations are reclaimed at the end of
                your shift.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>1.1.5 - All in a Day's Work</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You'll start your working day by boarding one of our chartered helicopters and departing for the
                <span style=color:#f70b6a;>restricted zone</span>. Be aware that once your helicopter departs, there's
                no turning back. You won't be able to
                return until your shift is over.
            </li>
            <li>Upon arriving at the job site, <span style=color:#f70b6a;>company-issued weapons</span> will be
                distributed to each employee. After you've
                received your weaponry, all you have to do is wait for Boss Salmonids to appear.</li>
            <li>You will receive a radio alert when Boss Salmonids are detected in the vicinity. It is not possible to
                provide precise coordinates, so it's up to you to find the exact location of the Boss Salmonids.</li>
            <li>The restricted zone is subject to a mysterious magnetic field known to have an effect on Inkling and
                Octoling sensory
                organs. You will be unable to use the Turf Map to check your surroundings or to perform Super Jumps.
                You'll have to rely on good, old-fashioned <span style=color:#f70b6a;>eyesight</span> to explore your
                surroundings.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, Boss Salmonids are not the only enemy you'll have to contend with. Lesser Salmonids will
                also interfere with your work, and will need to be dealt with in a suitable fashion. However, be aware
                that the <img src="media/PowerEgg.png" alt="Power Egg">Power Eggs dropped by Lesser Salmonids are far
                less valuable than the <img src="media/1GoldenEgg.svg" alt="Golden Egg">Golden Eggs dropped by
                Boss Salmonids. Therefore, we ask all employees to <span style=color:#f70b6a;>prioritize the collection
                    of <img src="media/1GoldenEgg.svg" alt="Golden Egg">Golden Eggs</span> over <img
                    src="media/PowerEgg.png" alt="Power Egg">Power Eggs.</li>
            <li>The Salmonids' sensory organs have adapted to the contaminants in their habitat, so they will not be
                hampered in hunting down Inklings and Octolings. Be very careful—you won't be able to hide yourself in
                ink.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>1.1.6 - Forming Bonds through Cooperation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Facing off against a Boss Salmonid on your own is a tall order. If you find yourself confronted with
                one, use your <span style=color:#f70b6a;>"This way!" signal</span> to call for help. This will
                communicate your position wirelessly to your coworkers.</li>
            <li>Carrying the <img src="media/1GoldenEgg.svg" alt="Golden Egg">Golden Eggs dropped by Boss Salmonids also
                requires the cooperation of the whole team, as
                the equipment provided allowed each worker to carry only <span style=color:#f70b6a;>1 <img
                        src="media/1GoldenEgg.svg" alt="Golden Egg">Golden Egg at a time</span>.</li>
            <li>In the event that you are splatted by a Salmonid, you'll wind up in a life ring, rendering you out of
                action. To rejoin the fray, you must wait for <span style=color:#f70b6a;>1 of your coworkers to revive
                    you with some of their ink</span>.</li>
            <li>While in a life ring, your "This way!" signal will automatically change to a <span
                    style=color:#f70b6a;>distress call</span>. Use this to let your coworkers know that you're in a bind
                so they'll come and revive you as soon as possible.</li>
            <li>If you approach the egg basket while holding a <img src="media/1GoldenEgg.svg" alt="Golden Egg">Golden
                Egg, you can press A to <span style=color:#f70b6a;>deposit</span> it.</li>
            <li>If you're not near the egg basket, you can press A to <span style=color:#f70b6a;>throw a <img
                        src="media/1GoldenEgg.svg" alt="Golden Egg">Golden Egg</span>. Use this to deposit eggs from far
                away, pass them to your coworkers, or put them in places where they're easy to retrieve. While throwing
                <img src="media/1GoldenEgg.svg" alt="Golden Egg">Golden Eggs is an efficient method of transport,
                please bear in mind that doing so expends ink, so plan accordingly.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>1.1.7 - Your Quota</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>In order to promote effective <img src="media/PowerEgg.png" alt="Power Egg">Power Egg collection, all
                teams have a <img src="media/1GoldenEgg.svg" alt="Golden Egg"><span style=color:#f70b6a;>Golden Egg
                    quota</span>.</li>
            <li>The Salmonids exhibit very predictable behavior. They will react aggressively to intruders into their
                territory, but will return to the water after a set amount of time. Teams that successfully meet their
                quota within that time period will be given a new quota to fill.</li>
            <li>This onslaught and retreat of Salmonids is called a <span style=color:#f70b6a;>wave</span>. The deadline
                to meet your quota is at the end of each wave, after which it will not be possible to deposit more eggs
                in the basket.</li>
            <li>Subsequently, all employees will be Super Jumped to the spawn point using special Grizzco technology,
                where they will be <span style=color:#f70b6a;>supplied with fresh weapons and splatted workers will be
                    revived</span>.</li>
            <li>Your shift is over at the end of the <span style=color:#f70b6a;>third wave</span>.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, in the event that your team is <span style=color:#f70b6a;>unable to meet its
                    quota</span>, we will have no choice but to <span style=color:#f70b6a;>terminate your shift</span>
                early.</li>
            <li>Additionally, if your entire work crew is splatted by Salmonids and <span style=color:#f70b6a;>wiped out
                    during a wave</span>, we will again have no choice but to <span style=color:#f70b6a;>terminate your
                    shift</span> early.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>1.1.8 - King Salmonids</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>In the Splatlands, there have been several reports of <img src="icons/S3_Icon_Cohozuna.png"
                    alt="Cohozuna"><span style=color:#f70b6a;>King Salmonid</span>
                sightings. King Salmonids are larger and more dangerous than Boss Salmonids.</li>
            <li>It's said that King Salmonids will gradually learn your <span style=color:#f70b6a;>scent</span> and will
                appear to chase away intruders that come back over and over again.</li>
            <li>If a King Salmonid shows up, we'll waive your <img src="media/1GoldenEgg.svg" alt="Golden Egg">Golden
                Egg quota. Instead, we ask that you stay calm and
                focus on driving back the King Salmonid.</li>
            <li>If a King Salmonid appears, we'll supply you with an <span style=color:#f70b6a;>egg cannon</span> that
                turns <img src="media/1GoldenEgg.svg" alt="Golden Egg">Golden Eggs into special shots that you can fire
                with A. These shots won't consume ink, so don't
                be shy about using them on the King Salmonid.</li>
            <li>When a King Salmonid appears, all leftover special pouches will be collected and then redistributed so
                everyone gets one. This rule ensures the most efficient use of limited resources.</li>
            <li>You can obtain durable <img src="icons/S3_Icon_bronze_fish_scale.png" alt="Fish Scale"><span
                    style=color:#f70b6a;>fish scales</span> from the bodies of King Salmonids. These are a very precious
                resource!</li>
            <li>In exchange for fish scales, we will provide <span style=color:#f70b6a;>a variety of limited-edition
                    goods</span>, so you should absolutely try to collect as many as you can.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>1.1.9 - Your Bonus</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>When your shift ends, you'll be awarded <span style=color:#f70b6a;>Grizzco Points</span> based on the
                number of <img src="media/1GoldenEgg.svg" alt="Golden Egg">Golden and <img src="media/PowerEgg.png"
                    alt="Power Egg">Power Eggs you and your coworkers have collected. After you have earned a set number
                of points, you will receive a <span style=color:#f70b6a;>fabulous bonus</span>, so make sure you work
                your very hardest to rack up those points!</li>
            <li>You can claim your bonuses from the <span style=color:#f70b6a;>exchange desk inside Grizzco
                    Industries</span>.</li>
            <li>The bonus lineup changes with each recruitment drive, and your Grizzco Points are also <span
                    style=color:#f70b6a;>reset</span> at the end of each drive.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>1.2.0 - Pay Grade</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Grizzco uses an employee-rating system to help workers progress along their chosen career path.</li>
            <li>Your pay grade increases when you <span style=color:#f70b6a;>meet your quotas</span> for all three
                waves.</li>
            <li>In the event that you are unable to meet your quotas, your pay grade will not be increased—and may even
                be decreased.</li>
            <li>As your pay grade increases, you'll be given a suitable <span style=color:#f70b6a;>title</span> to
                match.</li>
            <li>Raising your pay grade and getting new titles results in <span style=color:#f70b6a;>increased
                    bonuses</span>, but even better than that, it gives you the warm glowy feeling of overcoming a
                challenge!</li>
            <li>And don't worry! Although your pay grade will be reset for each new hiring period, you'll get to keep
                your title.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>1.2.1 - Evaluation Criteria</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Accomplishments: Results at Work</li>
            <li>Practical Skills: Judgement, Preparedness, Consideration, Initiative, Communication</li>
            <li>Innate Qualites: Attitude, Ambition, Experience, Style, Reflexes</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>1.2.2 - The Essence of the Job</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If you remember nothing else, please remember the following (everything else you can learn on the job):
            </li>
            <li>Get <img src="media/1GoldenEgg.svg" alt="Golden Egg">Golden Eggs from Boss Salmonids!</li>
            <li>Place eggs in the egg basket. Don't yolk around!</li>
            <li>Do you really need a third bullet point? Third bullet points are for eggs-ecutives.</li>
        </ul>
